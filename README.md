# Fundamentals-of-Python
This project showcases the essential fundamentals of the Python programming language, with a focus on data consistency and quality. It was developed as part of my learning journey during a data bootcamp.

 - The project includes practical examples of how to use Python for:
 - Data cleaning and manipulation
- Applying functions like split(), replace(), and others
- Organizing data using list
- Using control flow structures such as for and while loop
- Following good practices to maintain data integrity and consistency

Goal: To apply core Python concepts in real-world scenarios, reinforcing logic and building a solid foundation in data handling.

Note: Language - Portugues
This project is part of a Data Science bootcamp with Tripleten.
The structure and instructions were provided as part of the learning curriculum.
I completed the project independently and added my own analysis and comments where possible.
Iâ€™m continuing to learn and plan to apply these skills to original projects soon.
